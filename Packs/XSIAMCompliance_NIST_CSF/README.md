## **Generate Compliance Dashboards and Reports**
The NIST CSF compliance pack provides a dashboard and report template to ease your compliance monitoring and tracking. You can also use it as evidences in the yearly compliance audits and show auditors how data is tracked in XSIAM.
The dashboard and report in this pack utilizes XQL queries that reference the XSIAM data model (XDM). All data that has been onboarded to XSIAM and mapped to the data model will be automatically included in this dashboard and report.

**Note:** This pack is currently offered as a free beta of the Compliance module for a limited time. In the future, this module will be sold separately on top of XSIAM.


## **What does this pack do?**
- Install dashboard and report templates for the NIST CSF regulations.
- Reference data that has been mapped to the data model.
- Produce regulation evidence for audits.
